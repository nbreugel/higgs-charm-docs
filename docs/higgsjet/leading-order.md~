# Leading order Higgs plus jet

## 1. Flavour contributions

### 1.1 Leading order diagrams

In MadGraph, you can easily define the leading order signal using the following commands:
```shell
MG5_aMC> generate p p > h j
```
This command generates the Feynman diagrams that contribute to this process. The following diagrams are generated at leading order:

If we are working in the five flavour (5F) scheme and if the model parameters allow for non-zero light quark Yukawa couplings, then in principle each flavour apart from the top can appear in these diagrams. A generator-level simulation of 10,000 events yields the following results:

Process | \(\sigma\)[pb] | \(\sigma/\sigma_\text{tot}\) | 
------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
\(pp \rightarrow H b\) | 5.21 \(\times 10^{-1}\)| 62.1% |
\(pp \rightarrow H g\) | 2.33 \(\times 10^{-1}\)| 27.8% |
\(pp \rightarrow H c\) | 8.45 \(\times 10^{-2}\)| 10.1% |
\(pp \rightarrow H s\) | 3.76 \(\times 10^{-4}\)| 0.05% |
\(pp \rightarrow H d\) | 2.89 \(\times 10^{-6}\)| <0.1% |
\(pp \rightarrow H u\) | 8.83 \(\times 10^{-7}\)| <0.1% |

In the \(pp\rightarrow H q\) channel, the dominant contribution comes from bottom quarks. The contribution from the light quarks (\(u,d,s\)) is negligible. Essentially, a leading order Higgs plus jet sample would mainly consist of bottom jets, followed by gluon and finally charm jets.

### 1.2 Effective coupling

In the previous section, we discussed only the tree-level diagrams contributing to \(pp\rightarrow H + \text{jet}\). There is however another family of diagrams which will contribute heavily to the Higgs plus jet cross section. All of these diagrams are mediated by a \(Hgg\) coupling, which incorporates a quark triangle loop:

On the right, the loop has been replaced by an effective vertex, which in practice amounts to integrating out the dominant top quark contribution. If we include this \(Hgg\) coupling, then the following diagrams become physical:

The inclusion of the effective vertex results in the following flavour contributions to Higgs plus jet:


Process | \(\sigma\)[pb] | \(\sigma/\sigma_\text{tot}\) | 
------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
\(pp \rightarrow H g\) | 10.62 | 74.16% |
\(pp \rightarrow H b\) | 0.18  | 1.26%  |
\(pp \rightarrow H c\) | 0.38  | 2.65%  |
\(pp \rightarrow H s\) | 0.32  | 2.23%  |
\(pp \rightarrow H d\) | 1.08  | 7.54%  |
\(pp \rightarrow H u\) | 1.61  | 11.24% |
