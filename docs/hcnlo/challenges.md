## Yukawa couplings of light quarks

By default, the Yukawa couplings of the light quarks (uds) are set to zero in the `loop_sm` model. In fact, I believe that no couplings between the Higgs boson and the light quarks are coded into the model. However, since the light couplings differ only from the heavy couplings in their strength, one could easily copy the code that is already present for the heavy quark Higgs boson vertex.
